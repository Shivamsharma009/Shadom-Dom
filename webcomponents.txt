Front End developement is a prettry congestd area of technologies.we have many frontend framework.
like angular vue react and tools ont common thing in all framework is delivery high quality ui.

all of thes framework using encapsulation components. whrn i use a framework like angular react 
into split the ui into component and encapsulated. all of these framework break everything into 
components. using web components we can do it without uing any latest framework.



               what is web components
            ------------------------------

        1 . set of web platfrom api that allow us to create custom reuseable and encapsulated html tags
            to use in web pages and web apps.

        2.  Web components do not require any 3 party library or framework.

      

        Main Building blocks of web components
    --------------------------------------------

    custom Element
    shadom dom 
    html templates.



    1. custom Element    =>  In custom element they give us the capability
                                to create out custom element like html tags
                                footer paragraph we can extend in laso


                                this is done by creating a class in javascript

                                class Appdrawer extends Html Element
                                {
                                    window.custom.element,define(nameof tag , class name)
                                }


        implementation of custom element
        -------------------------------------



        Notes - : beacause they are in regilar dom
        
        But in a custom element h3 is coral and we don't have to do we want to encapsulate
        evertyhin or brak into components so for doing for encapuslation or break the component we use shadom dom.

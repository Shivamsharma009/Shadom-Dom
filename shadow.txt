Web Components set of web api that allow us to create custom reuseable and
encapsulated html tags to use in webpages.




Web Components has three parts
------------------------------------
1. Custom element
2. Shadom dom
3. html template


1.) In Custom element they give us the capability to create html tags just like you have 
    a header tags.
    this is done by creating a class with our javascript.


    Custom element lifecycle methods
    -------------------------------------------------
    constructor() -> called when an instance of the element is created or upgraded.
    connectedCallback() --> called every time when the element is inserted in to the dom.
    disconnectedCallback() --> called everytime the element is removed from the dom.
